I am a data scientist, locate in Toronto. My recent works focus on developing a hybrid model using design-and-model based methods to balance large-scaled non-probability samples, building segmentation tools for social and political ideologies, and predicting users socio-demographics for online advertising. I've created and maintained R packages for the internal use like panel management and analysis pipelines while working at Vox Pop Labs (VPL) from July 2014 to July 2017. 

Before joining VPL, I completed both my BSc. and MSc. in Statistics at University of Toronto. I participated in statistical consultant for a large-scaled field experiment, that applied behavioural science techniques to help people pay their past dues and get out of debt delinquency. To read more interesting findings from the study, you can find [it here] (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcpy.1031/epdf). I've also done some cool works on statistical inference like [vector exponential models] (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.309.9344&rep=rep1&type=pdf) and tagent exponential model.
